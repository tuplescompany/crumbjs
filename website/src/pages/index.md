# CrumbJS

CrumbJS is a lightweight API framework built for [Bun](https://bun.com/) that adds schema validation and automatic documentation on top of Bun's router while keeping an Express-like developer experience.

## Goals

- Focus on Bun's runtime
- First-class TypeScript support
- Simple, minimal core

CrumbJS pairs well with Bun's speed and uses Zod for validation with zero lockâ€‘in.
