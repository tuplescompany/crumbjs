CrumbJS is a lightweight API framework for [Bun](https://bun.com/) focused on backend development. It layers configuration, validation and documentation on top of Bun's built-in router while keeping a familiar Express-like developer experience. Validation is powered by [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) and every route can be automatically documented through OpenAPI.

The core system has only about 3,700 lines of code and just two dependencies (zod and openapi3-ts).

## Features

- Built for Bun.serve and only targets backend APIs
- Zod-based validation for bodies, queries and headers
- Automatic OpenAPI 3.1 document generation and UI (Swagger or Scalar)
- Auto-generate type-safe clients (eg. for frontend), with zero allocations.
- Simple middleware system and optional global middlewares
- Simple proxy helpers to forward requests and (optionally) document them â€” use app.proxy() for a single route, or app.proxyAll() to forward all routes under a given path.

## Included middlewares

- cors
- signals (log incomming request)
- secureHeaders

## Official Plugins
