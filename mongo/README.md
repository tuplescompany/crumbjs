The **CrumbJS Mongo Plugin** brings first-class MongoDB support into your CrumbJS applications.  
It provides everything you need to go from a plain collection to a fully validated REST API in minutes:

- üîå **Connection Manager** ‚Äì simple `MONGO_URI` setup or multiple named connections with full `MongoClientOptions` support.
- üìÑ **Schema helpers** ‚Äì thin wrappers around Zod (`document`, `field`, `timestamps`, `softDelete`) that enforce consistent schema shapes without hiding Zod‚Äôs flexibility.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Repository Layer** ‚Äì type-safe repository abstraction with helpers for pagination, filtering, soft deletes, and raw access to the underlying MongoDB collection when you need full control.
- ‚ö° **Auto-CRUD Resources** ‚Äì generate REST endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) automatically from a Zod schema, complete with validation, soft deletes, hooks, and OpenAPI docs.

In short: **define a schema once, and instantly get a secure, documented, production-ready API on top of MongoDB**, while still having the flexibility to drop down into raw repositories whenever you need custom logic.
